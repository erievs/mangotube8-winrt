# Things to Know #

- Sometimes this app is called MangoTube8 WinRT or even UWP (I got confused between universal 8.1 apps and UWPS), this is because I didn't settle on the name MangoTube8.1 untuil later so in the code it is still MangoTube8UWP (it is in fact not a UWP).

- No Windows Desktop Support 8.1 (Won't Work, I am 100% Sure)

- In resolutions other than 360p, there will be lip syncing issues. It'll be there because YouTube doesn't offer any other resolutions with audio built in so we have to sync it, and we cannot sync it SO much or else the app will be SUPER laggy.

-  They're only 3 resolutions FOR NOW, (as of 23/11/2024), they will be added later (not a ton of work but it'd take another hour and I am kind of tired).

-  Auto uses HLS (yes Apple's Tech), just wanted to let you know not super important.

-  Homepage Recommended videos are based on what you watch, every video you watch gets added to a list (that is stored), and a random video is picked (currently the last 5 videos you watched).

-  The Spotlight page only shows approximate views, as for some reason in this page only gives views in k format like 18.1k or something like that, but the other feids it is fine. I could fix this but it'd involve two requests for no reason.

-  Browse page doesn't work yet, all the feeds are implemented code side but I just haven't built a UI like.

-  This aims to recreate the Windows Phone 8 YouTube app fairly accurately (not perfect of course).

- Darkmode will be coming soon.

- Bugs I know about that will be fixed next update, rewind/backwards has some audio issues (not super hard to fix I know why just gotta sync em up), some places video IDs don't save to storage, rarely on startup the recommended page doesn't load, not a bug but not no background audio support for now (It is hard to do for me).

- Please report bugs in issues not on discord.

- Please don't have a list of a feature requsts, make one 'issue' for each, and please do not go overboard in feature requsts (I am not going to add TV playback or whatever THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK AND LIKE IDK IF IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE).

- This is a hobby project, I may refuse to repsond to support requsts, I have to say this because this has happened before but if you keep calling me on discord (I never call anyone I don't know IRL on discord) or annoy me I will be pissed off at you, I do not get paid, I like what I like don't arugue about colours or else I will force piss mode.
